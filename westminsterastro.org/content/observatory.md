The Blaine F. Roelke Memorial Observatory (BFRMO) is home to our primary instrument, a Celestron 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope previously owned by Mr. Roelke. The telescope is mounted on a Celestron CGE Pro computerized German-Equatorial mount, which allows for precise tracking of celestial objects. 

The building features a 3-meter diameter Ash dome. Siding and painting were provided by Carroll County Parks and Recreation.

The observatory is equipped with AC electrical service as well as white and red lighting. An exterior concrete pad is available for telescopes set up by visitors. Electrical service for these is provided by exterior outlets on the observatory.
