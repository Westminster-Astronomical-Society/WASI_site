Meeting ID: 879 7384 1396  
Passcode: 965007

Our speaker will be Lou Mayo, who is a planetary
scientist with over 40 years experience supporting NASA planetary research,
space missions, and space science data centers. He was a member of both Voyager
and Cassini IR Instrument teams and is currently chief scientist for GAMA-1
Technologies and professor of astronomy at Marymount University. Lou is also
president of ARIES Scientific, a small not for profit dedicated to astronomy
education. His primary research interests have been in understanding the
atmosphere of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, developing radiative transfer models
of aerosols and molecular species in Titan’s atmosphere.

Lou is also heavily involved in astronomy outreach and public communication. For
over a decade, he led NASA’s team to bring heliophysics mission science and
discovery to the country, including both Venus Transits and the 2017 solar
eclipse across America. For NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, over the last 20
years, he has spearheaded astronomy education programs for Girl Scouts, Amateur
Astronomers, university professors, and K-12 educators. And he is currently
featured on the YouTube show, 
[Space Oddities](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpBkfCh-XzOJxIZjgJxq1AQ)
which streams every Monday at 3pm EDT.

His talk is: In July and August of 1977, two space probes were launched on a
visionary mission of exploration of the outer solar system. These two Voyager
spacecraft, now roughly 150AU from Earth, rewrote the textbooks on planetary
science and continue to return valuable information about our universe from
beyond the heliosphere. In this talk, we will explore together the legacy of
Voyager through the eyes of the scientists and engineers who pioneered the
mission and brought its many discoveries to the world.
